# VeRFluent

Inspiration:

We were thinking about how when studying abroad, you are able to learn the language faster because you are immersed in the environment. You are being forced to communicate with the locals and adapt to this new culture quickly. Using VR, we thought we could emulate this immersive study abroad experience. Now students would be able to experience the culture and gain that language fluency without worrying about the costly prices of airline tickets and living expenses.

What it does:

VeRFluent puts the user into situations with objectives to complete, which aim to help the user improve his/her speaking and listening skills. Right now, our app supports Mandarin. The game simulates a short scenario of one eating at a Taiwanese host's house. The user will practice conversational phrases and vocabularies and learn the proper dinning etiquette.
