# VeRFluent

Inspiration:

We were thinking about how when studying abroad, it is easier/faster to learn the language due to its immersive nature and inability to communicate in your preferred language. With the idea of learning a languages and VR, we thought we could emulate this studying abroad experience without the costly prices of airline tickets and hotel fees as well as having a helping hand rather than completely being unable to communicate/understand.

What it does:

VeRFluent puts the user into situations with objectives to complete which teaches the user phrases, vocabulary, and culture with associated language. For our demo, we decided to focus on Chinese since most of our developers knew Chinese. With the time constraint, we created a short scenario of one eating at a Chinese person's home and the etiquette associated with it.
